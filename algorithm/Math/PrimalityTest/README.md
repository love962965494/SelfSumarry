## Primality Test

English:  
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 * 5 or 5 * 1, involve 5 itself, 6 is composite because it is the product of two numbers (x * 3) that are both smaller than 6.

一个质数是一个大于1的自然数且不可被比他小的两个数相乘得到的数。那些比1大且不是质数的自然数叫做合数。举个例子，5就是质数，因为它只能通过**1 * 5**或**5 * 1**得到；6就是合数，因为它可以通过**2 * 3**得到。

English:  
A primality test is an algorithm for determining whether an input number is prime. Among other fields of mathematics, is is used for cryptography. Unlike integer factorization, primality tests do not generally give prime factors, only stating whether the input number is prime or not. Factorization is thought to be a computationally difficult problem, whereas primality testing is comparatively easy (its running time is polynomial in the size of the input).

质数检测算法是一种判定输入数字是否是质数的算法。在其他数学领域中，常被用在加密学上。不同于整数因式分解，质数检测算法通常并不会给出质因子，只是简单的给出输入数字是否是质数。因为因式分解在计算上十分麻烦，而判定一个数是否是质数则很简单（算法执行时间是输入数字大小的多项式）。
