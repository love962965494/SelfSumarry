## Least common multiple
English:  
  In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, or smallest common multiple of two integers a and b, usually denoted by **LCM(a, b)**, is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b. Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if a and b are both different form zero. However, some authors define **Lcm(a, 0)** as 0 for all a, which is the result of taking the ***lcm*** to be the least upper bound in the lattice of divisibility.

在数学和数论中，两个整数a和b的最小公倍数，通常被定义为 **LCM(a, b)**，是可以同时被a和b整除的最小正整数。因为任何数除以0都会得到undefined，所以最小公倍数只有在a和b都不是0时才有意义。然而，有些作者定义 **lcm(a, 0)** 为0，认为lcm是单元格可以被整除的最小上界。

Example:  
Multiples of 4 are:  
> 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, ...

and the multiple of 6 are:
> 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, ...

Common multiples of 4 and 6 are:
> 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, ...

### Computing the least common multiple
> lcm(a, b) = | a * b | / gcd(a, b)
